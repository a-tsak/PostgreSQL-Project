# PostgreSQL - Semester Project

A university semester team project for the subject "Databases", that is split in three parts. The concept was that there are social media users who check in cities.

In the first part, we had to make the ER diagram for the concept, convert the Entity-Relationship Model into a Relational Model, find the functional dependencies, check if the relations are in 3NF or BCNF, and if they are in 3NF, to check if they can be converted to BCNF, and lastly, show the SQL commands to create the tables needed for the three entities, which is users, cities, and points of interest.

In the second part, we were given five .csv files in order to fill the tables with data. The three files would be used for the three entities mentioned above, and the other two files would be used for the association check-ins, and the association users' friends. We created five temporary tables in order to fill them with data from these files, and we inserted them into the final tables. Then, we also made tables for the associations that were based on the ER diagram in the first part of the project.

Finally, in the third part, we did SQL queries that were based on questions the project had.

All of this is included in the report as well as screenshots from the results.
